    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "* VADER uses rules to handle linguistic phenomena such as negation and intensification. Be sure to understand which rules are used, how they work, and why they are important.\n",
    "* VADER makes use of a sentiment lexicon. Have a look at the lexicon. Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?) What do all scores mean? https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) \n",

    "Regard the following sentences and their output as given by VADER. Regard sentences 1 to 7, and explain the outcome **for each sentence**. Take into account both the rules applied by VADER and the lexicon that is used. You will find that some of the results are reasonable, but others are not. Explain what is going wrong or not when correct and incorrect results are produced. \n",

    "1. Vader correctly identifies the sentence as being highly positive, due to the positive word 'love' being used, and thus gives it a high positive score and a positive compound score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vader sees the negation of 'love' accurately, and thus correctly gives it a negative compound score due to 'don't love' being used in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vader seems to be able to identify the smiley in the sentence, and also sees the word 'love' being used. Thus the sentence correctly gets a positive compound score, which is even more positive than the first sentence due to the smiley.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Vader sees the word 'ruins' and correctly identifies this as a negative word, with a high negative score. The negative compound score also reflects the negative sentiment of the sentence accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Vader accurately assesses the sentiment of the sentence, because the negative word 'ruins' is negated within this sentence with 'certainly not', leading to a positive compound score. The score is also not too high because this sentence is only negating a negative assessment of houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Vader is slightly off with this sentence, probably due to the word 'lies' being used in the sentence, which has multiple meanings, but the negative meaning is not used within this sentence. Vader correctly sees a lot of neutrality in this sentence, but also sees some negativity in the sentence, resulting in the compound score being off. The compound score reflects a pretty negative sentence, whereas this sentence is more of a neutral/lightly positive sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Vader is also slightly off in the last sentence. The sentence can be both a neutral or negative assessment of a house, because the house doesn't feel distinct from other houses. Vader correctly detects some neutrality in the sentence, due to 'any house' being a mostly neutral description. However, vader also saw the word 'likes', which probably increased the positivity score of the sentence, leading to a somewhat positive compound score. The positive and negative score should be interchanged, and the compound score should be closer to 0 or slightly negative to accurately reflect the slightly negative tone of this sentence."
